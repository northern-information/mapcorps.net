Not silence.

Silent. Not. Silent. Not.

Then - perhaps - sensitivity.

Silent. Between? Not. Between. Silent. Not. Between. Silent.

Many centuries later - perhaps - pitch.

Noise at this pitch. Noise at that pitch.

Yet, further - perhaps - envelope. And sequencing. And a myriad of strings that came to abstractly symbolize things we must consensually agree exist. Stone. Water. Food. Sky. Cold. Fire.

We must consensually agree exist.

We must consensually agree.

We must agree.
