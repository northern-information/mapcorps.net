Both [crow](https://monome.org/docs/crow) and [norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns) use [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). [sequins](https://monome.org/docs/crow/reference/#sequins) is a new feature in [crow 3.0](https://llllllll.co/t/46425) that I find very exciting. Today I'm going to port it over to norns.

First step is to review the existing code here: [https://github.com/monome/crow/blob/main/lua/sequins.lua](https://github.com/monome/crow/blob/main/lua/sequins.lua). At first glance it appears as though it can be straight up copy-pasta'd. Let's try it...

<iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=1089886470&parent=mapcorps.net" class="twitch-iframe" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Turns out the code works without any changes whatsoever.

Here's a sequin(ce) you can use:

```
s{
  s{0,12,0,0},
  s{1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,6,4,2,4,6,6,2,6,4,2,6,4,6,8,4,2,4,2,4,14,4,6,2,10,2,6,6,4,6,6,2,10,2,4,2,12,12,4,2,4,6,2,10,6,6,6,2,6,4,2,10,14,4,2,4,14,6,10,2,4,6,8,6,6,4,6,8,4,8,10,2,10,2,6,4,6,8,4,2,4,12,8,4,8,4,6,12}:step(s{3,5,7}),
  s{0,0,12,0},
  s{0,0,1,0,2,1,3,0,4,2,5,1,6,3,7,0,8,4,9,2,10,5,11,1,12,6,13,3,14,7,15,0,16,8,17,4,18,9,19,2,20,10,21,5,22,11,23,1,24,12,25,6,26,13,27,3,28,14,29,7,30,15,31,0,32,16,33,8,34,17,35,4,36,18,37,9,38,19,39,2,40,20,41,10}:step(1,2,3),
  s{0,0,0,12},
  s{0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,4,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,1}:step(13,15,16),
  s{12,0,0,0},
  0,
  3,
  7,
  0,
  3,
  s{7,5},
  0,
  3,
  s{5,7},
}
```

It is based on these data sets:

- [https://oeis.org/A059282/list](https://oeis.org/A059282/list)
- [https://oeis.org/A025480/list](https://oeis.org/A025480/list)

At some point in the future sequins may be merged into the norns core. Until then, you can [copy and paste this file directly into a norns script and it will work just fine.](https://github.com/monome/crow/blob/34ce1e455f01fdef65a0d37aa97163b4cd14a115/lua/sequins.lua)

Then invoke like this:

```
-- copy and pasted sequins code from link above goes here

-- then something like this:

lattice = require "lattice"
MusicUtil = require "musicutil"

engine.name = "PolyPerc"

payload = s{
  s{0,12,0,0},
  s{1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,6,4,2,4,6,6,2,6,4,2,6,4,6,8,4,2,4,2,4,14,4,6,2,10,2,6,6,4,6,6,2,10,2,4,2,12,12,4,2,4,6,2,10,6,6,6,2,6,4,2,10,14,4,2,4,14,6,10,2,4,6,8,6,6,4,6,8,4,8,10,2,10,2,6,4,6,8,4,2,4,12,8,4,8,4,6,12}:step(s{3,5,7}),
